/*! \mainpage SuperLU API Documentation

 SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large,
 sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance
 machines. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or
 Fortran. The library routines perform an LU decomposition with
 partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
 substitution.  The library also provides threshold-based ILU factorization
 preconditioners.

 The factorization routines can handle non-square
 matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
 matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
 either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for
 sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
 precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
 backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
 system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward
 error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
