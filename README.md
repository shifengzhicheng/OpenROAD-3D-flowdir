# OpenROAD-3D-flowdir

This repository contains the OpenROAD-3D flow directory which enables 3D physical design flows using the OpenROAD tools.

We just implemented the basic 3D flow without very great scripts and optimizations. The flow is based on the Open3DBench flow and is intended to be a starting point for further development.
